# AI-Driven Documentation Quality Product - Feature Breakdown

## Feature Overview

These are the core issues an AI agent could detect and fix to ensure developers have accurate, working documentation.

---

## 1. API Signature Accuracy
*(Imports, args, kwargs existence)*

### What to Detect:
- Function/method signatures in docs don't match actual codebase
- Missing required parameters
- Wrong parameter types (docs say `string`, code expects `int`)
- Incorrect default values
- Optional parameters marked as required (or vice versa)
- Return type mismatches

### Example Issue:
```python
# Docs show:
client.connect(host, port)

# Actual API:
client.connect(host, port, timeout=30, ssl=True)
```

### AI Agent Value:
Parse actual code, compare with documented signatures, flag discrepancies, suggest corrections

---

## 2. Code Example Validation

### What to Detect:
- Syntax errors in code snippets
- Runtime errors when examples are executed
- Missing imports at the top
- Undefined variables used in examples
- Examples that fail silently
- Copy-paste examples that don't work standalone

### Example Issue:
```javascript
// Docs show:
const result = await api.fetchData();
console.log(result.data);

// But api.fetchData() returns null on empty, causing runtime error
```

### AI Agent Value:
Actually execute code snippets in isolated environments, catch errors, verify output matches expected behavior

---

## 3. Consistency Issues

### What to Detect:
- Mixed naming conventions (getUserData() vs get_user_data())
- Inconsistent terminology (same concept called different things)
- Variable naming conflicts across examples
- Different code formatting styles
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Mixed async/sync patterns without explanation

### Example Issue:
```python
# Page 1 uses:
user_data = get_user(user_id)

# Page 2 uses:
userData = fetchUser(userId)

# Same function, different names
```

### AI Agent Value:
Establish style guide, flag violations, suggest standardized versions

---

## 4. Documentation Clarity & Structure
*(Instructions quality, logical flow, prerequisites, step completeness)*

### What to Detect:

**Instructional Clarity:**
- Instructions not informative enough or too vague
- Missing prerequisites or setup requirements
- Logical gaps in tutorial flow (Step 2 references something not created in Step 1)
- Steps that assume prior knowledge not mentioned
- Unclear explanations that don't match code examples
- Missing context about what each step accomplishes

**Structural Issues:**
- Missing step numbers in sequential tutorials
- Inconsistent section organization across similar guides
- Walls of text without headers/structure
- Examples without explanation of what they demonstrate
- Prerequisites buried mid-tutorial instead of at the top
- No clear indication of difficulty level or time required

**Following Difficulty:**
- "Difficult to follow" patterns that cause user drop-off
- Terminology inconsistencies within the same guide
- Ambiguous pronouns ("it", "this", "that" without clear reference)
- Jargon used without definitions or links to glossary
- Complex concepts introduced without scaffolding

**Technical Accessibility:**
- Broken links (internal and external)
- Missing alt text for images/diagrams
- Code blocks without language specification
- Missing file/directory references in setup steps

### Example Issue:
```python
# Docs show (Step 2):
# Configure your database connection
config = lancedb.Config.from_file('config.yaml')

# But Step 1 never mentioned creating config.yaml
# User is stuck: "What should be in config.yaml?"
```

```markdown
## Advanced Querying

You can use vector search to find similar items:

# Example without context
table.search([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).limit(10)

# Issues:
# - Where did this vector come from?
# - What does [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] represent?
# - How do I generate vectors for my data?
# - Prerequisites (embeddings) not mentioned
```

```markdown
## Installation

[Link to "Setting up Python environment" - 404]

You'll need Docker for this tutorial.
[Mentioned in Step 5, but should be in prerequisites at top]
```

### AI Agent Value:
**LLM-as-Judge Approach:**
- Agent follows tutorial as a human developer would
- Evaluates at each step: "Were the instructions clear?"
- Identifies logical gaps and missing prerequisites
- Scores clarity on structured rubric (0-10)
- Provides actionable suggestions for improvement
- Flags terminology inconsistencies across the document

**Traditional Validation:**
- Crawl and validate all links (404 detection)
- Check code blocks have language tags
- Verify sequential numbering in tutorials
- Analyze readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)

**Granular Failure Reporting:**
- Not just "tutorial is unclear"
- But "Step 3 in 'Quickstart Guide' references config.yaml not created in prior steps"
- Include section, subsection, step number, line number

### Success Signals:
**From Automated Testing:**
- Clarity score improvement (e.g., 6/10 â†’ 8/10)
- Reduced number of logical gaps
- Complete prerequisite coverage
- Consistent terminology throughout

**From User Behavior (if available):**
- Reduced Discord "How do I...?" questions
- Fewer GitHub issues about "unclear documentation"
- Lower drop-off rates at specific tutorial steps
- Fewer support requests per documentation page

---

## 5. Non-Existent APIs & Missing API Coverage

### What to Detect:
- Documentation for methods/classes that don't exist in codebase
- References to removed features still in docs
- Phantom configuration options
- Non-existent CLI commands
- Made-up error codes
- **Undocumented API endpoints that exist in the codebase**
- **Missing documentation for available configuration parameters**
- **New CLI commands without documentation**

### Example Issue:
```python
# Docs mention:
use db.optimizeQuery() for better performance

# But optimizeQuery() was never implemented or was removed
```

```python
# Codebase has:
@app.route('/api/v2/users/batch-update', methods=['POST'])
def batch_update_users():
    # New endpoint shipped 2 weeks ago

# But no documentation exists for this endpoint
```

### AI Agent Value:
Cross-reference all documented APIs against actual codebase, flag ghosts, suggest removal or alternatives. **Scan codebase for all available APIs/configs/CLI commands and identify missing documentation**

---

## 6. Deprecated API Usage & Configuration Drift

### What to Detect:
- Examples using deprecated functions without warnings
- Missing migration paths from old to new APIs
- No deprecation notices on old documentation pages
- Tutorials teaching deprecated patterns
- Changelog not reflected in docs
- **New config options/endpoints shipped but not documented**
- **Missing documentation for recently added API endpoints**
- **Configuration files with undocumented parameters**

### Example Issue:
```javascript
// Docs still show:
import { oldMethod } from 'library';

// But library now warns:
// oldMethod is deprecated, use newMethod instead
```

```yaml
# New config.yml has:
database:
  connection_pool_size: 10
  new_retry_policy: exponential  # <- Not documented anywhere

# But docs still only show old config options
```

### AI Agent Value:
Scan for @deprecated tags in code, find all doc references, auto-suggest modern alternatives, add warning banners. **Compare actual config schemas/API endpoints against documented ones, flag missing documentation for new features**

---

## 7. Real-World Integration Gaps

### What to Detect:
- Examples that work in isolation but fail in realistic scenarios
- Missing error handling for common failure cases
- No production-readiness guidance (rate limits, retries, timeouts)
- Security anti-patterns (hardcoded credentials, etc.)
- Scale considerations not mentioned (pagination, batching)
- Missing integration examples with popular frameworks/tools
- No mention of common "gotchas" or edge cases

### Example Issue:
```python
# Docs show simple example:
response = api.call()
print(response)

# Real world needs:
try:
    response = api.call(timeout=30, retry=3)
    if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
        # Handle rate limit
    # Validate response
    # Handle pagination
except APIException as e:
    # Proper error handling
```

### AI Agent Value:
Run integration tests, simulate failure scenarios, flag missing patterns, suggest production-ready versions
